The image above shows which bikes have the highest utilization based on the total usage time. This darker and larger bubbles shows that some bikes are used more frequently, which could mean they require more attention. However, it also shows that the majority of the bikes are utilized at similiar frequencies. 


## Summary 
The results have shown that based on New York City's trip data:

- Most trip times are under an hour
- The majority of subscribers use the bikes on weekdays at peak working hours such as 8AM or 5-6PM. 
- The majority of customers use the bikes on weekends in the afternoon
- The majority of users are male, females have similiar trip activity as males, however unknown gender types have different trip activity.  
- Younger users utilize the bikes for longer times
- The majority of bikes are utilized at similiar frequencies

For further analysis, two additional visualizations could help provide more insight:

- A visualization that shows user trips by birth year to provide more demographic insight and compare it to Des Moines' residents 
- A visualization that shows bike utilization on a map to determine what factors contribute to the higher utilization
